# Wiki Loves Monuments

This repo is a collection of code supporting the Wiki Loves Monuments competition on the German Wikipedia.

At the moment it mostly consists of bots that analyze and prepare the monument pages. 
See the [bots README](update-bot/README.md) for detailed documentation on the bots.
