# Wiki Loves Monuments

This repo is a collection of code supporting the Wiki Loves Monuments competition on the German Wikipedia.

At the moment it consists of bots that analyze and prepare the monument pages and a PHP script that redirects from Wikipedia links to the Commons Uploader.


See the [bots README](update-bot/README.md) for detailed documentation on the bots.

See the [redirect script README](redirect_script/README.md) for detailed documentation on the redirect scripts.
