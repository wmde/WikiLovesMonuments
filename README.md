# Wiki Loves Monuments

This repo is a collection of code supporting the Wiki Loves Monuments competition on the German Wikipedia.

At the moment it consists of bots that analyze and prepare the monument pages and a PHP script that forwards from Wikipedia links to the Commons Uploader, adding URL parameters.

See the [bots README](update-bot/README.md) for detailed documentation on the bots.

See the [forward script README](forward_script/README.md) for detailed documentation on the forward script.
